# Trader Goods Profiles Test Support

This service is a public-facing API to aid testing of the [Trader Goods Profiles API](https://github.com/hmrc/trader-goods-profiles).  It allows users to alter certain fields on Goods records stored in the [Trader Goods Profiles HAWK Stub](https://github.com/hmrc/trader-goods-profiles-hawk-stub), to simulate scenarios that cannot be performed via the TGP API.
